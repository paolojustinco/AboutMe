    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Paolo.
    \n\nI am a BS Computer Science student form the University of the Philippines Los Banos
    \n\nI enrolled in this course because I someday I want to develop my own app, or system that would be very useful and ground-braking for users, to make their lives easier and more convenient.
    \n\nI also dream of going in to the Motorsport scene in the future and be able to participate in different racing events around the Philippines and also worldwide.
    \n\nMy interests include: Computers, Mobile Phones, Technology, Cars, Biking and many more.
